# Improving Piazza

## Problem Space
Currently, many students at Johns Hopkins and other colleges utilize Piazza as a question and answer forum page. The use of Piazza has especially increased lately due to coronavirus where all classes are online and lack the in-person interactions. In addition, many professors put assignments and other relevant documents on Piazza. However, there are certain pain points with Piazza that relate to the search function as well as some administrative stuff. With this in mind I wanted to explore ways in order to improve Piazza.

## Contextual Inquiry
First, a contextual inquiry was performed. The subject (who we will refer to as subject in this document) is a student who does attends Johns Hopkins and has only used Piazza for one class starting this semester. The user was using my Piazza in order to do task 2. 

### **Intent 1:** Search for a post that has the subject “Important”
First, the user went to the search bar. They tried to type in “Important” but only received all results that had the word important in it. Next, they tried to type “Subject: Important”. However, the results were not pertaining to those that were titled with important. At this point there was a search tips dropdown that appeared below the search. The user clicked this and saw the query format in order to search for posts with the above title. In addition, they realized that they could search for certain phrases and use other specific queries to target their search. Finally, the user typed “subject: “Important”” and saw the correct results.

**Reflection** While the user did eventually find how to search for posts with the subject it took quite a bit of time. In addition, they were “lucky” in that they clicked on the search tips dropdown and that it appeared on the second search. If they did not they would not have discovered how to find the correct query.

### **Intent2** Drop/remove a class
First the user clicked my name which took them to a page that was completely different. They then went back to the homepage. From there they clicked resources which only showed information related to the current class. They then clicked the numbers next to resources, which signified the class number. From there they saw all the courses that the I was enrolled in and inactive ones. They clicked “manage class dropdown” which showed three bars by each class. Clicking on this, the subject realized that was only in order to reorder the classes. Now, they clicked the gear button next to the name. The subject then clicked “account/email settings”. From there they saw they could drop a class under class & email settings. 

**Reflection:** Dropping or removing a class seems incredibly difficult. The subject tried three different approaches before finally finding the one that solved the task. With this in mind they wished that it would be much easier or intuitive.

### **Intent 3:** Search for post #10
The user first went to the search bar and typed “10”. Only posts that contained the number 10 appeared but not post #10. Next they tried “#10” with the same results. Seeing the search tip dropdown menu again they clicked this only to find that searching for a certain post number was not outlined. Next they tried searching for “Post 10” and “Note 10” to no avail. After another 2 minutes of thinking they gave up for searching and rather scrolled to the bottom and went through each and every post until they came across post 10. 

**Takeway:** This is clearly a break point in the search feature. The user has no way of being able to search for a certain post even though the post numbers are shown. It makes no sense that the subject can see the post number but not search for a certain post number.
