    Improving Piazza
</h1>
<p>
    Problem Space:
</p>
<p>
    Currently, many students at Johns Hopkins and other colleges utilize Piazza
    as a question and answer forum page. The use of Piazza has especially
    increased lately due to coronavirus where all classes are online and lack
    the in-person interactions. In addition, many professors put assignments
    and other relevant documents on Piazza. However, there are certain pain
    points with Piazza that relate to the search function as well as some
    administrative stuff. With this in mind I wanted to explore ways in order
    to improve Piazza.
</p>
<p>
    Contextual Inquiry:
</p>
<p>
    First, a contextual inquiry was performed. The subject (who we will refer
    to as subject in this document) is a student who does attends Johns Hopkins
    and has only used Piazza for one class starting this semester. The user was
    using my Piazza in order to do task 2.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Intent 1</strong>
    : Search for a post that has the subject “Important”
</p>
<p>
    First, the user went to the search bar. They tried to type in “Important”
    but only received all results that had the word important in it. Next, they
    tried to type “Subject: Important”. However, the results were not
    pertaining to those that were titled with important. At this point there
    was a search tips dropdown that appeared below the search. The user clicked
    this and saw the query format in order to search for posts with the above
    title. In addition, they realized that they could search for certain
    phrases and use other specific queries to target their search. Finally, the
    user typed “subject: “Important”” and saw the correct results.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reflection</strong>
    : While the user did eventually find how to search for posts with the
    subject it took quite a bit of time. In addition, they were “lucky” in that
    they clicked on the search tips dropdown and that it appeared on the second
    search. If they did not they would not have discovered how to find the
    correct query.

<p>
    Intent 2: Drop/remove a class
</p>
<p>
    First the user clicked my name which took them to a page that was
    completely different. They then went back to the homepage. From there they
    clicked resources which only showed information related to the current
    class. They then clicked the numbers next to resources, which signified the
    class number. From there they saw all the courses that the I was enrolled
    in and inactive ones. They clicked “manage class dropdown” which showed
    three bars by each class. Clicking on this, the subject realized that was
    only in order to reorder the classes. Now, they clicked the gear button
    next to the name. The subject then clicked “account/email settings”. From
    there they saw they could drop a class under class &amp; email settings.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reflection:</strong>
    Dropping or removing a class seems incredibly difficult. The subject tried
    three different approaches before finally finding the one that solved the
    task. With this in mind they wished that it would be much easier or
    intuitive.

    />
</p>
<p>
    Intent 3: Search for post #10
</p>
<p>
    The user first went to the search bar and typed “10”. Only posts that
    contained the number 10 appeared but not post #10. Next they tried “#10”
    with the same results. Seeing the search tip dropdown menu again they
    clicked this only to find that searching for a certain post number was not
    outlined. Next they tried searching for “Post 10” and “Note 10” to no
    avail. After another 2 minutes of thinking they gave up for searching and
    rather scrolled to the bottom and went through each and every post until
    they came across post 10.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Takeway</strong>
    : This is clearly a break point in the search feature. The user has no way
    of being able to search for a certain post even though the post numbers are
    shown. It makes no sense that the subject can see the post number but not
    search for a certain post number.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Intent 4: Modify current email notifications
</p>
<p>
    The subject first clicked the gear button on the top right. From there they
    saw “Account/Email settings” and clicked this. They then scrolled down to
    class &amp; email settings and clicked on “Edit email notifications” for a
    certain class. From there they changed the email settings.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Takeways:</strong>
    It seems that the subject was easily able to find and modify the current
    email settings. It seems that this was built in a way that is easy to use
    and intuitive.
</p>

    />
</p>
<p>
    From the above contextual inquiry, it seems that tasks 1,2, and 3 seem the
    most important for redesigning. The prototype will aim to solve these three
    issues.

    The following sequential models were created using miro. The tasks (colored
    in blue) and subsequent breakdowns (colored in red) are explained.

    Paper Based Prototype:
</p>
<p>
    The protype aimed to solve the breakdowns as listed from before. There were
    two main areas of improvement. The first related to the search feature.
    Before, search was very limited and not very intuitive, so the prototype
    aimed to address these issues. In addition, dropping a class was very
    challenging so the prototype aimed to fix that. The key improvements are as
    follows:
</p>
<p>
    -It is clear what the course number means as it is appended by the word
    “courses”
</p>
<p>
    -It is easy to drop a course as a student goes to their class breakdown and
    can drop directly from there
</p>
<p>
    -Search is now highly customizable and allows basic and advanced search
</p>
<p>
    -A user can search with different filters and order based on date/relavance
</p>
<p>
    If we look at the below image, we see that when a student goes into their
    classes from the main page (which now has the word “courses” before the
    number) they are able to directly drop a class from this menu.
</p>
<p>

    />
</p>
<p>
    If we look at the search we see that it now is highly customizable. The
    student can still use the basic search of utilize advanced search where
    certain parameters can be used.
